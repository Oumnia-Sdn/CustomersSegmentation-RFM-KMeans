    "E-commerce has become a new channel to support businesses development. Through e-commerce, businesses can get access and establish a wider market presence by providing cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for their products or services. E-commerce has also changed the way people shop and consume products and services. Many people are turning to their computers or smart devices to order goods, which can easily be delivered to their homes.\n",

Their customers come from all over the world and usually make direct purchases for themselves. There are also small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through retail outlet channels.\n",
    "The dataset contains 500K rows and 8 columns. The following is the description of each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TransactionNo (nominal): a six-digit unique number that defines each transaction. The letter “C” in the code indicates a cancellation.\n",
    "- Date (numeric): the date when each transaction was generated.\n",
    "- ProductNo (nominal): a five or six-digit unique character used to identify a specific product.\n",
    "- Product (nominal): product/item name.\n",
    "- Price (numeric): the price of each product per unit in pound sterling (£).\n",
    "- Quantity (numeric): the quantity of each product per transaction. Negative values related to cancelled transactions.\n",
